For my web desgin this week I created another mockup website for my clothing brand "yung society"
I went with a dark background with white text keeping symmetry involved. 
I made sure to add 3+ pages for my page including a home page, products, team, and a test page where I created an interactive piece. 
I also included 
Framework Integration, Framework Styling Elements, HTML5 Canvas with a looping video JavaScript Functionality with my fidget section under my test page
