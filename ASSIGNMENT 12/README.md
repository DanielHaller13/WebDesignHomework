Sizing – Control the width and height of elements on the page.
I wanted my website to feel full and complete using all the space 
Overflow – Manage how content is displayed when it exceeds the element’s boundaries.
I used borders to help define my spacing and in one of my images it went a little bit over its boundaries but I had the image cut off with the border
Border – Define and style borders around elements for emphasis or separation.
I used borders within my borders for my images 
Margin – Adjust the space outside an element, creating separation from other elements.
I used seperation from my images and my header as well as the seperation between my text and my logo
Padding – Set the space inside an element, between its content and border.
My images within it's borders have a lot of room and deadspace
Position – Control the placement of elements with properties like absolute, relative, or fixed.
I wanted to use a lot of symmetry and keep everything centered making it easy in my opinion to read the website the proper way.
