Assignment 3  
How's the course going?  
I got very confused on dates and due dates but I am going back and turning assigments in and I am enjoying class
Things I'm excited to learn: 
- Github
- organizing my files
- just how difficult it is to create websites!  

What can be improved:
- all of my other classes assigments have set due dates that i can add to my calander and have everything done on time. for some reason this classes assigments were not showing up on my calander and it confused me.
